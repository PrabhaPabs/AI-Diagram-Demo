# Frequently Asked Questions (Security, Privacy & Support) # 
## FAQ 5 ##

### 1. How secure is AIDiagramMaker? ###
Security is a top priority for us. We build our platform on top of modern, secure cloud infrastructure and follow industry best practices for data protection. This includes things like encrypting your data, regularly patching our systems, and designing our application to be resilient to common threats.

### 2. Where is user data stored? ###
Your data is stored with major, reputable cloud providers who maintain a very high standard of physical and network security. We use data centers that are SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR compliant, ensuring your data is housed in a secure and regulated environment.

### 3. Do you use third-party data processors? ###
Yes, like almost every modern software company, we do. We use a small number of trusted third-party services for essential functions like processing payments (Stripe) and hosting our infrastructure (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud). We have a rigorous process for vetting these subprocessors to ensure they meet our high standards for security and privacy.

### 4. Is my data encrypted? ###
Yes. All data, including your diagrams and personal information, is encrypted both "in transit" (as it moves between your browser and our servers) using TLS, and "at rest" (while it is stored in our databases) using industry standard encryption algorithms like AES-256.

### 5. Can anyone else access my diagrams? ###
By default, your diagrams are private to your account. No one else can see them unless you explicitly choose to share them with your team members or by creating a public share link. Our support team may need to access your diagrams to help you with a specific issue, but they will only ever do so with your express permission.

### 6. How often are backups taken? ###
We perform regular, automated backups of all user data. This ensures that in the unlikely event of a major system failure, we can restore your data and the service with minimal disruption.

### 7. What happens if the server goes down? ###
We have designed our system for high availability. We have monitoring in place that alerts our engineering team immediately if there are any issues with our servers. Our goal is always to resolve any outages as quickly as humanly possible to minimize the impact on our users.

### 8. Do you comply with GDPR or other privacy laws? ###
Yes. We are fully committed to complying with the GDPR and other major privacy regulations. We have clear policies around data ownership, user rights (like the right to be forgotten), and how we handle personal information.

### 9. How can I delete my account and data permanently? ###
You have the right to delete your account and all associated data at any time. You can usually find this option in your account settings. When you choose to delete your account, we will permanently and irreversibly remove all of your personal information and the diagrams you have created from our systems.

### 10. Is my data shared with AI models? ###
This is a great question. We want to be very clear: we do not share your private diagram content with any third-party AI model providers or use it to train their general-purpose models. The AI processing happens within our secure environment.

### 11. What happens if I accidentally delete a diagram? ###
Unfortunately, in most cases, when you delete a diagram, it is permanently deleted from our system. We do this for privacy reasons. We recommend being careful when deleting your work, as it is not typically something we can recover for you.

### 12. How do I contact support? ###
The best way to get in touch with our support team is through the official channel listed on our website, usually a support email address or a contact form within the application. This ensures your request is logged in our system and routed to the right person.

### 13. Do you offer live chat or only email support? ###
Currently, our primary support channel is email. We have found this allows us to provide thoughtful, detailed responses and to properly investigate any issues. We do, however, plan to explore live chat as an option for our higher-tier plans in the future.

### 14. What’s your average response time? ###
We always aim to respond to support requests as quickly as possible. For users on our paid plans, we target a response time of within one business day, though it is often much faster. Responses for users on the free plan may take a little longer.

### 15. How can I report a bug or issue? ###
If you think you have found a bug, we would be very grateful if you would report it to our support team. Please be as detailed as possible in your report, including what you were doing, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. Screenshots are always incredibly helpful.

### 16. Do you have a knowledge base or documentation? ###
Yes. We have a growing knowledge base or help center that contains articles and guides on how to use the product's features. We are always adding to it based on the questions we get from users.

### 17. Is there a community or forum for users? ###
This is something we are actively considering. We would love to create a space where our users can share tips, showcase their creations, and help each other out. Stay tuned for more on this.

### 18. Can I request new features? ###
Please do. We love hearing ideas from our users. While we can't promise to build every feature that is requested, user feedback is the single most important input into our product roadmap. The best way to submit a feature request is through our official support channel.

### 19. How often do you release updates? ###
We are constantly working to improve the product. We typically deploy small bug fixes and improvements several times a week. Larger new features are usually released every few weeks.

### 20. How do you handle user feedback? ###
We read every single piece of user feedback that comes in. It is all collected and regularly reviewed by our product and engineering teams. It is a critical part of how we decide what to build next. We genuinely believe that the best ideas come from the people who use our product every day.
